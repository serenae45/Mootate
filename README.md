Game instructions:
Players have 2 minutes to find the hidden alarm on the map while trying to not be attacked by the animals. 
The alarm will be invisible until you come within a close enough vicinity for it to appear.
When you find the alarm, an alarm sound will play, and you win the game!
You can move around the map using the arrow keys or the WASD keys. 
There is a "hot or cold" temperature bar that shows how close you are to finding the alarm when you walk around.
Farm animals are walking around and will attack you if you get close enough to them.
Player must shapeshift into different animals to prevent being attacked.
Each animal has a total of 2 enemies, which can be referenced in the top left corner of the screen at all times. 
The animals will only attack the player when they are seen as the farmer or any of their enemy animals.
To avoid getting attacked by a certain animal, you must transform into an animal that is not one of their enemies.
Players can shapeshift using the appropriate number keys, which are seen beside the animals on the enemy display. 
You only have 3 lives and if attacked by an animal, you lose a life.
You lose the game if you run out of lives or run out of time before finding the alarm. 
The escape button can be used to pause the game and will show the game controls again if needed.
